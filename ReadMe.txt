Appendices:

A: KC_Schools
B: AppendixB_preprocessing.Rmd
	crimedata_clean.csv [This is the resulting clean dataset: used in next appendices]
C: AppendixC_crime_analysis.Rmd
	school_crimes.csv [This is the integrated data set, the number of crimes within 1 mile of each school: used in the next appendices]

Note:

In .Rmd files you will need to change the directory of which the files are located and then everything should run. Then since I gave the files created in each preceding R script you do not need to fun the Appendices in order.

Then in the final paper's figure's description I refer to the page number in which the visualization was created. This is based off the pdf version of the .Rmd files. This can be accessed in the [Appendix B-D Pdfs] folder for easy viewing
